It was a rimy morning, and very damp. I had seen the damp lying on the outside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there all night,
and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief. Now, I saw the damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass,
like a coarser sort of spiders' webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade.
